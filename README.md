# Five-word finder

## What does this do?

This program, given a word list, finds all sets of five words, each of
five letters, such that no letter is repeated.

## Why?

I was contagiously nerd-sniped by
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-AfhLQfb6w . Someone on a Rust
channel I'm on mentioned it, it piqued my interest, and this is my
solution.

https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt is
used as the word source.

## Excuses

My Rust style is not great. When trying to write efficient code, I
just end up writing C in Rust. It's a hack to exercise the algorithm,
so error handling and user-friendliness are not high up the list. It
probably has bugs. Sorry.
